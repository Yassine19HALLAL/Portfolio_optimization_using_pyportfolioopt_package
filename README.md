# Portfolio_optimization_using_pyportfolioopt_package
## Introduction :

In this work, we have conducted portfolio optimization using the mean-variance optimization technique implemented through the powerful pyportfolioopt library in **Python**. 

Mean-variance optimization is based on **Harry Markowitz**’s 1952 classic paper, which spearheaded the transformation of portfolio management from an art into a science. The key insight is that by combining assets with different expected returns and volatilities, one can decide on a mathematically optimal allocation.

The primary objective of this work was to construct and analyze three distinct portfolios with varying optimization goals.

- The first portfolio aimed to minimize volatility, emphasizing stability and capital preservation. 
- The second portfolio, unconstrained in its approach, focused on maximizing the Sharpe ratio, which balances risk and reward.
- Finally, the third portfolio incorporated L2 regularization as a constraint, striving to strike a balance between risk management and performance optimization.

To evaluate the effectiveness of these portfolios, we plotted the efficient frontier, which represents the set of portfolios that offer the highest expected return for each level of risk. This visualization provides valuable insights into the risk-return trade-offs and allows for a comprehensive comparison of the three optimized portfolios.

By leveraging pyportfolioopt's mean-variance optimization capabilities, we were able to construct portfolios that align with different investment objectives and risk preferences.

The analysis and comparison of these three portfolios on the efficient frontier enable us to understand the impact of different optimization strategies on risk, return, and the overall portfolio composition.
